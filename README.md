# 🌙 MIRNet for Low-Light Image Enhancement

This project implements the **MIRNet** (Multi-Scale Residual Network) model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to enhance images captured in low-light conditions. It leverages advanced attention mechanisms and residual learning for high-quality image restoration.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

Simply run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

* 📥 Automatically download the **LOL (Low-Light) Dataset**
* 🧠 Train the **MIRNet** model
* 💾 Save the best-performing model as `best_model.h5`
* 📂 Generate enhanced outputs in a `results/` directory
* 📊 Display side-by-side comparisons:

  * Original Image
  * PIL Autocontrast
  * MIRNet Enhanced Image

## 🧬 Model Architecture

MIRNet follows a robust **multi-scale residual network** design, which includes:

* 🔁 **Multi-scale feature extraction**
* 👁️ **Parallel attention mechanisms** (spatial + channel attention)
* 🔄 **Residual learning** for detail preservation
* 🔗 **Skip connections** for stable training and gradient flow

---

## 📈 Training Details

* 🎯 **Loss Function:** Charbonnier Loss (robust to outliers)
* ⚙️ **Optimizer:** Adam
* 📐 **Evaluation Metric:** PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
* ⏹️ **Early Stopping:** Applied to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization

---

## 📷 Results

All outputs are saved in the `results/` directory and include:

* ✅ Enhanced low-light images
* 🆚 Comparison plots (Original vs Autocontrast vs MIRNet)
* 📉 Training metrics and loss history

## 📌 Note

* For best performance, use a GPU-enabled machine.
* Ensure internet connectivity for dataset download.
